## Concepts

**Cura** is an experimental project on the [NEAR sharded blockchain](https://near.org) that explores the use of non-fungible tokens as creative tools. On top of ownership and provenance, the goal is to explore this new expression of `Media` , built on smart contracts, as not only a pointer to art, but as the art itself.

A canvas for building an open web on NEAR; The initial version is geared towards generative art as a great way to gather around projects and build communities.

The current goal of this repository is to remove the overhead and allow any code artist to be able to come and experiment, iterate and deploy.

The long-term goal is to have an ecosystem of media projects forked or born here that come together through their tokens and DAOs with value flowing in from [_media_](https://cryptomedia.wtf).

We're starting with front-end hooks, themed components, and composable smart contracts that respect [NEAR standards](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/README.html) but give room for creativity and customization.
